# COTWSaveManager

COTWSaveManager is a simple tool for the game theHunter: Call of the Wild that allows you to keep multiple game saves without having to move any files yourself.
The tool available in [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/thehuntercallofthewild/mods/268)

# Installation

Installing this program is as simple as:
1) Creating a folder anywhere on your computer
2) Extract all files to said folder
3) \[Optionally] creating a desktop shortcut

# Notes

It is recommended that you backup your saves regularly, especially before using the tool for the first time, as I haven't had the chance to thouroughly test it yet.
