# COTWSaveManager

COTWSaveManager is a simple tool to allow you to keep multiple game saves without having to move the files yourself.

# Installation

This tool requires little installation process:
1) Create a folder anywhere on your computer for the tool
2) Extract all files to that folder
3) Enjoy!

# Notes

It is recommended that you backup your saves regularly, and specially before using the tool for the first time, as I haven't had the change to thouroughly test it yet.
